    Make predictions using the provided model on the test data.

    This function takes a trained machine learning model and a test dataset,
    and returns the predicted values for the test data.

    Args:
        model: The trained machine learning model that will be used to make predictions.
        xtest: The test data on which to make predictions. This should be in the same
               format as the data used during model training (e.g., a pandas DataFrame or NumPy array).

    Returns:
        array-like: The predicted values for the test dataset.
